# The NAND programming languages

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for the NAND family of programming languages that accompany the upcoming book [Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science](http://introtcs.org).

You can launch all the notebooks live using [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/boazbk/nandnotebooks/master) (this service is in beta status and sometimes takes a long time).

The main notebooks contained in this repository are:

1. [The NAND Programming Language](https://github.com/boazbk/nandnotebooks/blob/master/NAND%20programming%20language.ipynb)  (   [live version on binder](https://hub.mybinder.org/user/boazbk-nandnotebooks-221ipnov/notebooks/NAND%20programming%20language.ipynb) ): Definition of the NAND programming language, relation to Boolean circuits, syntactic sugar, computing every function, and representing it as list of triples

2. [Blog post about the course](https://github.com/boazbk/nandnotebooks/blob/master/blog.ipynb): giving a high level overview of the main results in the course.

3. [NAND++ programming language](https://github.com/boazbk/nandnotebooks/blob/master/NANDpp_overview.ipynb): an overview of the NAND++ programming lanaguage.

4. [The Cook Levin Theorem](https://github.com/boazbk/nandnotebooks/blob/master/Cook_Levin.ipynb): overview of the Cook Levin Theorem.

5. [Lambda calculus](https://github.com/boazbk/nandnotebooks/blob/master/lambda.ipynb): some notes on the lambda calculus and the Y combinator. (In somewhat incomplete state.)

__Note:__ As of Summer 2018 I am changing a bit the syntax of the languages, and hence some notebooks use the older syntax `foo := bar NAND blah` and some use the newer syntax `foo = NAND(bar,blah)`
