# The NAND programming languages

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for the NAND family of programming languages that accompany the upcoming book [Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science](http://introtcs.org).

You can launch all the notebooks live using [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/boazbk/nandnotebooks/master)

The main notebooks contained in this repository are:

1. [The NAND Programming Language](https://hub.mybinder.org/user/boazbk-nandnotebooks-221ipnov/notebooks/NAND%20programming%20language.ipynb): Definition of the NAND programming language, relation to Boolean circuits, syntactic sugar, computing every function, and representing it as list of triples


__Note:__ As of Summer 2018 I am changing a bit the syntax of the languages, and hence some notebooks use the older syntax `foo := bar NAND blah` and some use the newer syntax `foo = NAND(bar,blah)`
